# DSA Calendar 2026 | Plan of Action 🔥

DSA is no longer about solving random sheets or memorizing solutions.
It’s about a clear, structured, and realistic approach from **absolute beginner to interview-ready Candidate.**

* How to start DSA **from zero** (even if you don’t know coding)
* When to focus on **language basics vs DSA**
* A **3-phase preparation strategy** used by serious engineers
* Exact timelines for **topics, patterns, and problem counts**
* Why **300–400 problems ≠ success** (and what actually matters)
* How to shift from *learning mode* to *real problem-solving mode*
* Contest strategy, mistake tracking, and revision framework
* Advanced concepts you should touch (and when)

## 🟢 PHASE 1: Foundation Level Preparation (0 → Beginner)

This phase is **only for beginners**. If someone knows **nothing about coding**, don't panic.

### ✅ Step 1: Pick ONE Programming Language

Choose **one language only** (C++ / Java / Python / JavaScript)

❌ No language hopping

❌ No framework first

Your goal here is **not DSA**. Your goal is to **understand the language itself**:

- Variables & data types
- Conditions & loops
- Functions
- Arrays & strings
- Basic recursion
- Input / Output thinking

📌 Follow **one complete beginner-friendly tutorial** from start to end.

### ✅ Step 2: Build Logical Thinking (Very Important)

After basics, start solving **simple programming problems**.

This is where **150 Programming Problems Sheet** comes in.

**Why this phase matters:**

- Builds **logical thinking**
- Improves **problem understanding**
- Removes fear of problem statements

👉 Don't rush

👉 Don't skip

👉 This phase builds your **base**

## 🟡 PHASE 2: Data Structures & Algorithms Preparation

Now you enter **structured DSA learning**.

### 🎯 Your goals in this phase:

- Understand **DSA concepts**
- Learn **patterns**
- Understand **algorithm flow**
- ❌ NOT memorizing solutions

### ✅ What to Do

Pick **ONE high-quality DSA resource**

It must cover:

- Topics from **0 → advanced**
- All **core data structures**
- Common **problem-solving patterns**
- ~**300–400 problems** (quality > quantity)

⚠️ **Important:** Solving 300–400 problems is **not the goal**. Understanding **WHY a solution works** is the goal.

📺 Watch first: **"How to Pick the Right DSA Resource"**

### ⏳ Timeline

**3–4 months total**

Cover everything:

- Arrays → Graphs
- Recursion → DP
- Trees → Advanced patterns

**Focus on:**

- Concepts
- Flow of algorithms
- Pattern recognition

## 🔴 PHASE 3: Problem-Solving Level (THE REAL PREPARATION) 🔥

Now stop *learning*. Start **practicing like an engineer**.

This phase decides your **interview performance**.

### ✅ What to Do Daily

- Solve **POTD (Problem of the Day)**
- Solve **random Easy & Medium problems**
- ❌ Stop following sheets blindly

When you can:

- ✔ Solve Easy comfortably
- ✔ Solve Medium with effort

➡️ Move to **Virtual Contests**

### 🧠 Contest Strategy

- Start with **10–20 virtual contests**
- Even **2–3 solved problems** are enough
- Focus on:
    - Thinking under pressure
    - Time management
    - Approach clarity

Then move to **real contests**

### 📌 Most Important Rules

- Solve **random problems**
- Write down **mistakes**
- Identify **weak areas**
- Fix them deliberately
- Parallel revision using:
    - Problem-solving docs
    - Concept-based videos

⏳ Maintain discipline for **4–6 months**
